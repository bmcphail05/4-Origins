@snap[west span-60]
The dramatic social changes of the Industrial Revolution (mid-1700s to mid-1800s) helped spark the development of the social sciences, as early sociological thinkers struggled with the vast implications of economic, social, and political revolutions.

### Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
@snapend

- **social facts**: “manners of acting, thinking, and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him”
  - aspects of social life that shape individual actions  

---
@snap[north span-100]
### Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
@snapend

- Q: How do societies hold together?
  - A: Solidarity (social cohesion, social "glue")

- Earlier less complex societies are held together homogeneity & similarity, which Durkheim called **mechanical solidarity**.
- Societies characterized by mechanical solidarity share a very strong belief and moral structure.

@snap[north span-100]
### Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
@snapend

- Increased specialization and differentiation leads to interdependence, cooperation, and shared values that he called **organic solidarity**.

- Society is like an organism, with specialized parts that work together as an integrated whole.

- **division of labor**: “…the specialization of work tasks by means of which different occupations are combined within a production system.”

@snap[north span-100]
### Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
@snapend

- Q: How do societies exert control over people’s actions?
  - A: Social constraints (ways that society influences individual behavior)
- In times of rapid social change, social constraints can become weak, which can lead to **anomie**, a situation in which social norms lose their hold over individual behavior.
- *Suicide* (1897) examined anomie.

### Karl Marx (1818–1883)
@snapend

- In Marx's **materialist conception of history** material, or economic, factors have a primary role in determining historical change and the source of conflict in society.

- The Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between the owners of the factories and workers.

---
@snap[north span-100]
### Karl Marx (1818–1883)
@snapend

- **capitalism**:
an economic system based on the private ownership of wealth, which is invested and reinvested in order to produce profit
  - capitalism -> conflict
- Because the rich exploit the poor and the poor seek ways to overcome that exploitation (i.e., revolt).

---
@snap[north span-100]
### Karl Marx (1818–1883)
@snapend

- predicted the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by **communism**, an economic system under which there is no private or corporate ownership (i.e., everything is owned communally and distributed as needed)
- believed that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism
