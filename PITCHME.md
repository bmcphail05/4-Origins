# Industrial Revolution (mid-1700s to mid-1800s)

The dramatic social changes of the Industrial Revolution gave greater urgency to the development of the social sciences, as early sociological thinkers struggled with the vast implications of economic, social and political revolutions.  

All the major figures in the early years of sociology thought about the “great transformation” from simple, preliterate societies to massive, complex, industrial societies.

# Auguste Comte (1798–1857)

- French philosopher
- coined the term sociology, which he saw as the scientific study of human behavior and society
- believed that social scientists could study society using the same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences
- sought to understand how societies construct order out of chaos
- advocated for social planning to improve people's lives

---
# Harriet Martineau (1802–1876)
- English writer
- first woman sociologist
- first to translate Comte’s writing to English
- credited with the first systematic methodological international comparisons of social institutions in two of her most famous sociological works: *Society in America* (1837) and *Retrospect of Western Travel* (1838)
- expanded sociological research to include neglected institutions, neglected members such as women, and neglected issues like marriage, children, race relations, and domestic and religious life

---
# Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
- French social psychologist and philosopher
- established sociology as a scientific discipline by developing methodological principles that guide research in *Rules of the Sociological Method* (1895)
- **social facts**: aspects of social life that shape individual actions  

---
# Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
- Q: How do societies hold together? A: Solidarity (social cohesion)
- Society is like an organism, with specialized parts that work together as an integrated whole.
  - increased specialization and differentiation led to interdependence, cooperation, and shared values that he called **organic solidarity**.

---
# Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)

**division of labor** is “…the specialization of work tasks by means of which different occupations are combined within a production system.”

- With the development of industrialism, the division of labor became vastly more complex than in any prior type of production system.”

---
# Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
- Q: How do societies exert control over people’s actions? A: Social constraints
- Social constraints can become weak in times of rapid social change, which can lead to **anomie**, a situation in which social norms lose their hold over individual behavior (i.e., individuals feel that their lives lack meaning
- Durkheim’s study of suicide examined the anomie that comes when social constraints break down during periods of rapid social change.
---
# Karl Marx (1818–1883)

- German economic, political, and social theorist
- coauthored the *Communist Manifesto* (1848) with Friedrich Engels (1820–1895)
- believed that societies grew and changed as a result of the struggles of different social classes over the means of production.
---
# Karl Marx (1818–1883)

In Marx's **materialist conception of history** material, or economic, factors have a primary role in determining historical change and the source of conflict in society.

the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between the owners of the factories and workers

**capitalism**:
an economic system based on the private ownership of wealth, which is invested and reinvested in order to produce profit

capitalism -> conflict
- because the rich exploit the poor and the poor seek ways to overcome that exploitation (i.e., revolt)

---
# Karl Marx (1818–1883)

- predicted the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by **communism**, an economic system under which there is no private or corporate ownership (i.e., everything is owned communally and distributed as needed)
- believed that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism

---
# Max Weber (1864–1920)
- a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist
- his ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research
- believed values and ideas (not economics like Marx) were the impetus for social change
---
# Max Weber (1864–1920)
- Studied the role religion played in the development of capitalism
- In *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (1904), Weber argued that certain aspects of Christian beliefs and practices influenced the development of capitalism.

---
# Max Weber (1864–1920)
- also observed that social, economic, and cultural life was becoming organized according to principles of efficiency, which he called the **rationalization of society**
  - the process by which modes of precise calculation and organization, involving abstract rules and procedures, increasingly come to dominate the social world.

- Out of rationalization came a new form of organization, the **bureaucracy**: s type of organization marked by a clear hierarchy of authority and the existence of written rules of procedure and staffed by full-time, salaried officials.

# W. E. B. Du Bois (1868–1963)
- first African American to graduate from Harvard University
- was critical of Marx for having ignored the importance of race in an understanding of social inequality
- argued that race was important determinant of social stratification in the United States
- As an advocate of social reform, he was one of the founding members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
