Origins of Sociology

Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the relationship between individuals and the societies to which they belong. Many topics studied in modern sociology were also studied by ancient philosophers in their desire to describe an ideal society, including theories of social conflict, economics, social cohesion, and power.

People have been thinking like sociologists long before sociology became a separate academic discipline: Plato and Aristotle (382-322 BC), Confucius (581-479 BC), Khaldun (1332-1406), and Voltaire (1694-1778) all set the stage for modern sociology. (image of these in slides)

But it was until the great changes of the Industrial Revolution in Europe that sociology became its own discipline.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Western Europe was rocked by technical, economic, and social changes that forever changed the social order.  Science and technology were developing rapidly.  James Watt invented the steam engine in 1769, and in 1865 Joseph Lister discovered that an antiseptic barrier could be placed between a wound and germs in the atmosphere to inhibit infection.  These and other scientific developments spurred social changes and offered hope that scientific methods might help explain the social as well as the natural world.  This trend was part of a more general growth in rationalism.  

The industrial revolution began in Britain in the late eighteenth century.  By the late nineteenth century, the old order was collapsing “under the twin blows of industrialism and revolutionary democracy” (Nisbet, 1966: 21).  Mechanical industry was growing, and thousants of people were migrating to cities to work in the new factories.  People once rooted in the land and social communities where they farmed found themselves crowded into cities.  The traditional authority of the church, the village, and the family were being undermined by impersonal factory and city life.

Capitalism also grew in Western Europe in the nineteenth century.  This meant that relatively few people owned the means of production—such as factories—while many others had to sell their labor to those owners.  At the same time, relatively impersonal financial markets began to expand.  The modern epoch was also marked by the development of administrative state power, which involved increasing concentrations of information and armed power (Giddens, 1987: 27).

Finally, there was enormous population growth worldwide in this period, due to longer life expectancy and major decreases in child death rates.  These massive social changes lent new urgency to the deveopment of the social sciences, as early sociological thinkers struggled with the vast implications of economic, social and political revolutions.  All the major figures in the early years of sociology thought about the “great transformation” from simple, preliterate societies to massive, complex, industrial societies.

Next we'll move on to some of the key figures

#Auguste Comte
-Although the term sociology was first used in 1780 by French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836), Auguste Comte (1798–1857) reintroduced the word in 1838.
- believed that social scientists could study society using the same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences

The French philosopher, Auguste Comte, coined the term sociology, which he saw as the scientific study of human behavior and society.
French society at the time was experiencing changes stemming from industrialization and urbanization that some people believed would lead to chaos and massive disorder.
Comte tried to understand how societies construct order out of what appears to be chaos.
He was a strong advocate of social planning and believed that scientific knowledge could be used to improve people’s lives.


# Harriet Martineau (1802–1876)
- first to translate Comte’s writing from French to English and thereby introduced sociology to English-speaking scholars
-credited with the first systematic methodological international comparisons of social institutions in two of her most famous sociological works: Society in America (1837) and Retrospect of Western Travel (1838).


Harriet Martineau, born and educated in England, was a prolific writer of social life.
In Positive Philosophy, she translated Auguste Comte’s writings and her tour of the United States resulted in her own book, Society in America (1837).
Martineau was also active in the abolitionist and early women’s movements.
Martineau is known for expanding the scope of sociological research to include neglected institutions, neglected members such as women, and neglected issues like marriage, children, race relations, and domestic and religious life.

Harriet Martineau, an English social theorist and Whig writer. She is often referred to as the first woman sociologist.


It is important to recognize that the early theorists—Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber—were products of their own histories.
Who they were affected how they viewed the world and what they defined as a problem to be studied.
Although in one way or another they all studied inequality, stratification, and the distribution of power in society, they neglected to study women and racial minorities.


# Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)
Émile Durkheim is a very important figure in sociology.

He established sociology as a scientific discipline by developing methodological principles that guide research.

Émile Durkheim, a French social psychologist and philosopher.


- helped establish sociology as a formal academic discipline by establishing the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895 and by publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method in 1895.
-concerned about developing a methodology, a set of principles to guide their research
-he coined the term social facts, which were aspects of social life that shape individual actions. He believed we should analyze these social facts as rigorously as objects or natural events
-Society was like an organism, with specialized parts that work together as an integrated whole - This social cohesion he called organic solidarity.


Durkheim argued that social life—or social facts—could be analyzed just as rigorously as natural scientists studied objects or events in the natural world.
A key concern for Durkheim was solidarity.
He wanted to know how societies were held together.

how does society hold itself together despite the fact we all have different interests? 


Looking at the world around him, he observed that social life was becoming increasingly differentiated or specialized.
He wondered if such differences would get in the way of social order.
He found that rather than tear society apart, increased specialization and differentiation led to interdependence, cooperation, and shared values that he called organic solidarity.
Organic solidarity comes from the interdependence of society’s different parts and shared values.

Durkheim was also interested in how society exerts control over people’s actions.
This social control is what Durkheim called social constraints.
Social constraints can become weak in times of rapid social change, which can lead to another one of Durheim’s terms, anomie (defined in a later slide.)

The division of labor is another important term used by Durkheim.
His analysis of social change is based on the development of this concept.
From the definition box in the textbook:
The division of labor is defined as: “…the specialization of work tasks by means of which different occupations are combined within a production system.”

“All societies have at least some rudimentary form of division of labor, especially between the tasks allocated to men and those performed by women.”

“With the development of industrialism, the division of labor became vastly more complex than in any prior type of production system.”
“In the modern world, the division of labor is international in scope.”
When social constraints can become weak in times of rapid social change, this can lead to anomie.
When social constraints becomes weak and create conditions of anomie (where individuals feel that their lives lack meaning), this may lead people to commit suicide.

Durkheim’s study of suicide examined the anomie that comes when social constraints break down during periods of rapid social change.


Whereas Marx had an eye for conflict and disruption, Durkheim asks us to think of social solidarity and stability as something special to be explained, not as a default or taken-for-granted experience.



# Karl Marx (1818–1883)

Unlike Durkheim, for whom order achieved through consensus, cooperation, and shared values was important, Karl Marx examined conflict in society.

Karl Marx, a German economic, political, and social theorist.

In his materialist conception of history, Marx saw economics as the driving force for social change and the source of conflict in society.

According to Marx, capitalism creates conflict because the rich exploit the poor and the poor seek ways to overcome that exploitation.

For Marx, this conflict brought on by the exploitation of the poor by the rich under capitalism will bring social change.

As we will see elsewhere in the textbook, Marx continues to influence broad theoretical perspectives in sociology that treat conflict, not order, as a normal feature of society.


- a German philosopher and economist. In 1848 he and Friedrich Engels (1820–1895) coauthored the Communist Manifesto. This book is one of the most influential political manuscripts in history. It also presents Marx's theory of society
- believed that societies grew and changed as a result of the struggles of different social classes over the means of production.

- At the time he was developing his theories, the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between the owners of the factories and workers. Capitalism, an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of goods and the means to produce them, grew in many nations.

- Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers would eventually revolt. This would lead to the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by communism. Communism is an economic system under which there is no private or corporate ownership: everything is owned communally and distributed as needed. Marx believed that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.

- While his economic predictions may not have come true in the time frame he predicted, Marx’s idea that social conflict leads to change in society is still one of the major theories used in modern sociology.


# Max Weber (1864–1920)

Max Weber, a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist whose ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research.

Like Marx, Max Weber was also interested in capitalism.
But Weber saw values and ideas, not economics, as the impetus for social change.

He studied the role religion played in the development of capitalism.

In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904), Weber argued that certain aspects of Christian beliefs and practices influenced the development of capitalism.

Weber also observed that social, economic, and cultural life was becoming organized according to principles of efficiency, which he called the rationalization of society.

Out of rationalization came a new form of organization, the bureaucracy.
Weber’s study of bureaucracy continues to play an important role in sociology.

# William Edward Burghardt “W. E. B.” Du Bois (1868–1963)
W.E.B. Du Bois is a critical figure in the development of sociology. He made lasting and profound contributions to the social sciences by pioneering several sociological methodologies. For many years though, these efforts were largely ignored and omitted from history.

His now well-known studies introduced and implemented many of the principles that became the foundation for modern sociology, some 20 years before the University of Chicago developed what is considered the first department of sociology in the United States.

Du Bois was an impressive scholar, skilled civil rights activist, prolific social scientist, and the first African American to graduate from Harvard University with a doctorate.


W. E. B. Du Bois was the first African American to graduate from Harvard University.
His concept of double consciousness brought to light the notion that African Americans see themselves both through their own eyes and through the eyes of a society that demeans them.

He was critical of Marx for having ignored the importance of race in an understanding of social inequality.

Du Bois argued that race, or “the color line,” continued long past slavery was abolished to be an important determinant of social stratification in the United States.

Du Bois connected race to social and economic stratification.
As an advocate of social reform, Du Bois was one of the founding members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Du Bois has been an extremely influential thinker, and the current Black Lives Matter movement shows some of his ideas.
